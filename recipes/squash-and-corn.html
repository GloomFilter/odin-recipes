        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ears corn, husked and cleaned</li>
            <li>2 yellow squash, diced</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place corn into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low
                and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>While the corn is cooling, place squash into a skillet and add water. Cook over medium heat until
                tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess water from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Cut kernels off the cobs. Stir corn, butter, parsley, salt, and pepper into squash; cook, stirring
                occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
